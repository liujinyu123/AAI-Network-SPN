In summary, there are three contributions of this work.
* In order to better represent voice information, we extract the local features and the global features through 1DCNNs and multi-head attention module respectively.
* We propose a new phoneme stream network to gain the phoneme features to improve the performance of speaker-independent experiment.
* Based on the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed model outperforms SOTA obviously on public HPRC dataset which decreases by 0.18mm on RMSE and increases by 6% on PCC.

## Results of the experiments.
